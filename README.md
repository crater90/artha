### Artha.io
**NFT based dApp marketplace for digital brands**

### The problem Artha.io solves
Our application democratizes the consumption and consolidation of the decentralized network for digital brands and their customers. It allows the brands to create their unique presence on Web3, thereby creating thriving economic communities on the internet of tomorrow.

### Challenges we ran into
A core feature of our application is one-click dApp enablement, this was a difficult task as we had to deploy both the smart contract and frontend application as the user clicks on the button. We had to create factory pattern-based smart contracts, and maintain permission scopes and dynamic routes and pages as and when the NFTs were minted and dApps were added to these NFTs.

Technologies we used

React
Polygon
IPFS/Filecoin
Web3.Storage
